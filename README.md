# Hello-World
This is my first repository for GitHub. I'm learning Python as my first language. 

Shortly after obtaining my Bachelor's of Science in Public Administration, I began to see how integral technology was for society and civilization. Knowing this, I felt pursuing my interests in Business Information Technology would help me incorporate new ways of thinking and working into my career and plans for the future.

While I've always been a quick study of new software and hardware, I knew that I could gain much more than a passive understanding of how the gadgets I used work. I wanted to understand how they were created and one day, perhaps, create my own. I'm striving toward that goal every day. That is why I created a github account. It's the best way I know of to merge my interests in business, technology, and society beneath one umbrella. 

Armed with a variety of tools and resources, it is my aim to one day create new and better ways of thinking, working, and living. I hope that I can have at least a small, positive impact upon the lives of everyone I have the pleasure of helping. Technology is humanity's future. I aspire to help write a page or two in that book.
