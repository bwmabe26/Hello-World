# Hello-World
This is my first repository for GitHub. I'm learning Python as my first language. 
My goal is to work toward earning my Master's Degree in Business Information Technology within the next 2-3 years. 

Shortly after obtaining my Bachelor's of Science in Public Administration, I began to see how integral technology was for society and civilization. Knowing this, I felt pursuing a Master's Degree in Business Information Technology would be a great way for me to gain understanding and insight into how modern tech works. 

While I've always been a quick study of new software and hardware, I knew that I could gain much more than a passive understanding of how gadgets I used work. I wanted to understand how they were created and one day, perhaps, create my own. I'm striving toward that goal every day. That is why I created a github account. It's the best way I know of to establish myself in the IT field and to merge my interests in business, technology, and society beneath one umbrella.
